;;; Commentary:

;; Provides helpful description of the arguments to C functions.

(require 'eldoc)

;; make sure that the opening parenthesis in C will work
(eldoc-add-command 'c-electric-paren)

;; NOTE: most people with normal GNU systems won't need to mess with
;; these options.

;; if you aren't using /lib/cpp as your preprocessor, set the
;; replacement here
(defvar c-eldoc-cpp-command "gcc -E")

;; if you've got a non-GNU preprocessor with funny options, set these
;; variables to fix it
(defvar c-eldoc-cpp-macro-arguments "-dD -w -P")
(defvar c-eldoc-cpp-normal-arguments "-w -P")

;; if you aren't using a program named grep or it needs a path to
;; execute, set that here
(defvar c-eldoc-grep-command "grep")

;; add in your commonly used packages/include directories here, for
;; example, SDL or OpenGL. this shouldn't slow down cpp, even if
;; you've got a lot of them
(defvar c-eldoc-includes "`pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags` -I./ -I../ ")

;; how expansive is your code? if you've split your declarations into
;; one variable per line AND write functions w/ a ridiculously large
;; number of parameters, you might need to up this. it will make the
;; macro slightly less efficient
(defvar c-eldoc-context "10")

;; NOTE: i didn't really want -m 2, but it segfaults sometimes with
;; -m1 and the -dD option! TODO: why is this?
